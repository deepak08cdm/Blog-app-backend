## MERN stack Assignment to create Twitter clone
  Backend code for the Twitter clone app will come here. This app will be built using express js. For databases, you can use MongoDB Atlas or any other online service.

### Approach:-
1. First of all we need to authenticate the user to sign in or let the user to sigh up.
   ##### Note:- use a post route to authenticate a user
3. For home page we need to get all the stored blogs
    * get route to get all the blogs
    * a post route if user writes a route
    * a get route to fetch a particular blog data and corresponding comments
    * on the same we need put route so that users can add comment on that particular blog.


you can use anydata base(mongodb atlas prefered) and make the backend server secured so that no other hostname can make call to the end-points
